    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last Updated: 22.12.2024</p>
    <p>Thank you for using the “Connection Test App” (the “App”). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use,
        disclose, and safeguard your personal information when you use our App. If you do not agree with the terms of
        this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App.</p>
    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <h3>OAuth Information</h3>
    <p>When you connect your Facebook (or another third-party) account to our App, we receive certain data from the
        OAuth flow (such as an access token). This data is used strictly to enable the connection test functionality.
    </p>
    <h3>Automatically Collected Information</h3>
    <p>We may automatically collect certain information about your device when you access the App, such as your IP
        address, browser type, operating system, and usage details (e.g., the features you use). This information is
        used to monitor and improve the functionality of the App.</p>
    <h3>Optional User-Provided Information</h3>
    <p>If you choose to provide additional information (e.g., by contacting us directly), we may collect and store that
        information to respond to your inquiry or provide support.</p>
    <h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Establish and maintain the connection with Facebook or other OAuth providers.</li>
        <li>Provide, operate, and improve the App’s features and functionality.</li>
        <li>Diagnose technical issues and ensure the performance of the App.</li>
        <li>Communicate with you regarding updates or support requests.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
    <h3>Service Providers</h3>
    <p>We may share your information with third-party vendors or service providers who perform services on our behalf
        (e.g., hosting, analytics) to facilitate or improve the App. These parties only access your information to
        perform tasks for us, and they are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose.</p>
    <h3>Legal Obligations</h3>
    <p>We may disclose your information if required by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g.,
        a court or a government agency).</p>
    <h3>Business Transactions</h3>
    <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your personal information may be transferred.</p>
    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain your data only for as long as is necessary to provide the connection test functionality or comply with
        legal obligations. Once no longer needed, we will securely dispose of or anonymize your information.</p>
    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We use commercially reasonable measures to safeguard your information against unauthorized access, alteration,
        disclosure, or destruction. However, no security measure is completely foolproof, and we cannot guarantee
        absolute security.</p>
    <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our App is not directed to children under the age of 13 (or other age as required by local law). We do not
        knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such
        information, please contact us so we can promptly delete it.</p>
    <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be effective immediately upon posting the
        revised Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the App after any changes indicates your acceptance of the updated
        terms.</p>
