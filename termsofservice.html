        using the App, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have the legal
        capacity to enter into a binding agreement.</p>

    <h2>2. Use of the App</h2>

        <li>Modify, reverse engineer, or attempt to gain unauthorized access to any part of the App.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, features, and functionality of the App (including text, graphics, logos, software, and user
        interfaces) are owned by us or our licensors and are protected by intellectual property laws. You agree not to
        reproduce, distribute, modify, or create derivative works from any part of the App without our express prior
        written permission.</p>

    <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The App may integrate with or link to third-party services (e.g., Facebook). We do not control, endorse, or
        assume any responsibility for any third-party services, their content, or their policies. You agree to comply
        with any applicable terms of these third-party services when using them in conjunction with our App.</p>

    <h2>5. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, the App is provided on an “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE” basis without
        warranties of any kind, whether express or implied. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including
        but not limited to implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and
        non-infringement. We do not guarantee that the App will be error-free, uninterrupted, or secure.</p>

    <h2>6. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the extent permitted by law, we shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or
        punitive damages, or any loss of profits or revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of
        data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your access to or use of or inability to access or use the App;</li>
        <li>Any conduct or content of any third party on the App;</li>
        <li>Any unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your transmissions or content;</li>
        <li>Any other matter related to the App.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In no event shall our total liability for all claims related to the App exceed the amount you paid us, if any,
        for using the App.</p>

    <h2>7. Indemnification</h2>
    <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the App’s owners, developers, affiliates, and service providers
        from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including legal fees, arising out of or
        in any way connected with your use of the App, your violation of these Terms, or your violation of any
        third-party rights.</p>

    <h2>8. Termination</h2>
    <p>We reserve the right to terminate or suspend your access to the App at any time, without notice, for conduct that
        we believe violates these Terms or is harmful to other users, us, or third parties, or for any other reason at
        our sole discretion.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>We may update these Terms from time to time at our sole discretion. Any changes will become effective upon
        posting the revised Terms. Your continued use of the App after the effective date of the updated Terms
        constitutes your acceptance of the changes.</p>

    <p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of your jurisdiction without regard to its
        conflict of law principles. Any legal action or proceeding arising under these Terms shall be brought
